# Hangman Game in Python
**Hangman** is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
# Rules
The rules for this game is very simple:
1. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. 
2. A random word is picked up from the word collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
3. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
4. To make it easier for the players, they can have length of word + 3 chances. So for example, word to be guessed is tangerine, then user gets 9 + 3 = 13 chances, as tangerine has 9 letters.
